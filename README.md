This is our python project of making a calculator. We have decided from the start to use tkinter as teh GUI and learnt its basics, then immediately proceed to making the project.          

Making the layout of the calculator!

In this calculator, a casing is utilized for making the screen, and two marks, one for putting digit button and the other for work keys are utilized. 
We used sub-labels inside these labels to put buttons on it.

Making the screen
Entry box is used for making the screen of the calculator.

Offering life to the Buttons 
Till this stage our calculator was almost finished, basically, it was not functionable. We took a stab at restricting buttons to the capacities however the outcomes were imprinted on the control center and not on the calculator's screen, so we had to go at utilizing lambda in the buttons and it worked!

At the point when you see our code, you'll see that we've remarked out some piece of our code, that is on the grounds that we were attempting to add one more button in the calculator 'erase' which would erase only the principal digit from the right yet when we were testing it, it is tossing out certain mistakes. So  we will update it when we discover the arrangement.
